Small utility to print all scopes from a repository that follows [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits]
or Angular-like commit conventions.

## Why

When you're contributing to a new repository that follows the Conventional Commits specification, or alternatively,
the Angular one, is sometimes difficult to figure out which scopes previous contributors have used. While you could
leave that to the maintainer, this utility makes it easier to learn which scopes are used in a particular repository,
so you can format your commit message accordingly.

## Installing / Getting Started


```shell
npm install -g conventional-commits-print-scopes
cd <repo>
conventional-commits-print-scopes
```

Example output:

```shell
navigation
auth
native
system
core
...
```

## Developing

### Built With

* [git-log-reader][git-log-reader].
* [Ramda][ramda].

### Pre-requisites
